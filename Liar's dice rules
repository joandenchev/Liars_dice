2 modes - normal, wild
Options

Each player has a cup with 5 dice
Round based game 

When the round starts players roll their dice
First player begins his turn by "bidding"

BIDDING - announce face value and number of dice, claiming how many dice with this particlar value are there on the WHOLE table

Turns rotate in a clockwise order
Next player chooses between making a HIGHER BID or CHALLENGING the previous bid

RAISING THE BID - the player can bid a higher quantity of the same face or any quantity of a higher face
CHALLENGING THE BID - reveals all dice and check if the bid is valid
VALID BID - there are at least as many face values as were bid (or more)

If the bid is valid - the bidder wins, else - the challenger wins
Losing a round lowers a player's dice count by 1

At round start the player who lost a dice last round goes first
If the player was eliminated, then the next player (clockwise) begins

THE GAME IS WON BY THE PLAYER WHO RETAINS A DIE AT THE END

Wild mode:
The “ones” face of the dice is considered wild – it always counts as the face of the current bid
